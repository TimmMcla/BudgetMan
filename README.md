# BudgetMan

BudgetMan is an app that will allow you to create a budget without any of the risks of losing their personal data by hackers. Simply put the information is only available on the device. There is no backup anywhere. Lose your phone, lose your information just like the good ol days. Now some may look at this as a risk, but speaking from personal experience my identity has been compromised four times in the last ten years. 

Addressing the security risk will be one way to circumvent any attacks. In a future release the application will incorporate a lock screen, if the user fails to input the correct code three times, then the app will delete all data contained within the app. **BOOM!** security granted. Anyways, this is just a side project that I am using to learn more about how Android Room works. Thanks for reading!
